Simple yet flexible weight-based shipping for WooCommerce

== Description ==

Weight Based Shipping is a simple yet flexible shipping method for WooCommerce focused mainly on order weight (but not limited to) to calculate shipping cost. Plugin allows you to add multiple rules based on various conditions.

<br>

= Features =

<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Order weight, subtotal and destination</strong><br>
        Create as many shipping rules as you need for different order destinations, weight and subtotal ranges.
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>Flexible Price Calculation</strong><br>
        Each rule can be configured to expose a constant price (like Flat Rate) or a progressive price based on cart weight, or both.
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>Conditional Free Shipping</strong><br>
        In some cases you want to ship for free depending on subtotal, total weight or some other condition. That can be achieved in a moment with the plugin.
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>Shipping Classes Support</strong> (available in the <a href="https://weightbasedshipping.com">Plus version</a>)<br>
        For each shipping class you have you can override the way shipping price is calculated for it.
    </li>
</ul>

See <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/weight-based-shipping-for-woocommerce/screenshots/">screenshots</a> for the list of all supported options.

= 2.2.1 =

Allow zero weight shipping. Thus only Handling Fee is added to the final price.

Previously, weight based shipping option has not been shown to user if total weight of their cart is zero. Since version 2.2.1 this is changed so shipping option is available to user with price set to Handling Fee. If it does not suite your needs well you can return previous behavior by setting Min Weight to something a bit greater zero, e.g. 0.001, so that zero-weight orders will not match constraints and the shipping option will not be shown.
